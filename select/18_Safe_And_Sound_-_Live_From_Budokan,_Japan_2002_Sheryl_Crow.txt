Maybe this is forever
Forever fades away
Like a rocket ascending into space
Could you not be sad
Could you not break down
After all I won't let go

Until you're safe and sound
Until you're safe and sound
There's beauty in release
There's no one left to please
But you and me

I don't blame you for quitting
I know you really tried
If only you could hang on through the night
Cause I don't want to be lonely
I don't want to be scared
And all our friends are waiting there

Until you're safe and sound
Until you're safe and sound
There's beauty in release
There's no one left to please
But you and me

(Until you're safe and sound)
Feel like I could've held on
Feel like I could've let go
Feel like I could've helped you
Feel like I could've changed you
Feel like I could've held you
Feel like I could've hurt you
Feel like I was a stranger
Feel like I was an angel
Feel like I was a hero
Feel like I was a zero
Feel like I could've heard you
Feel like I could've held you
Feel like I could have touched you
Feel like I could've moved you
Feel like I could've healed you
Feel like I could've told you
Feel like I could've loved you
Feel like I could've loved you
Feel like I really loved you
Feel like I really loved you
Feel like I really loved you
Feel like I really loved you
Feel like I really loved you
Feel like I really loved you
Feel like I really loved you
