Do the dance, do the dance

Under the spotlights
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance

As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens
Do the dance, do the dance

Man up, hold tight
Driving dark
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound

Time's up, kick start
Keep on track
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound

Man up, hold tight
Driving dark
Do the dance, do the dance

Head up, foot down
Speed of sound
The way you move is a mystery

Time's up, kick start
Keep on track
Do the dance, do the dance

Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound
You're always there for music and me

Man up, hold tight
Driving dark
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound

Time's up, kick start
Keep on track
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound
